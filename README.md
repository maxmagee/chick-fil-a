# Note

Chick-fil-A completely re-designed their application while I was in the middle of my replication implementation. As a result, I'm freezing work on this repo and starting fresh here: [Chicken](https://github.com/maxmagee/chicken)

I will likely re-visit this and create some sort of demo page to illustrate the work I was able to accomplish, but for now I'm moving on to the new version.

# Chick-fil-A

The goal of this project is to replicate the existing [Chick-fil-A One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chick-fil-a/id488818252?mt=8) mobile application using React Native. This project is designed to illustrate my capabilities as a React Native developer to potential employers.

## Why This?

From what I can tell, the current production Chick-fil-A One app was built using React Native by [The BHW Group](https://thebhwgroup.com/projects/chick-fil-a) located in my home-town of Austin. If I can get reasonably similar results to a current well-respected firm, I've successfully demonstrated my value. Also, I'm a big fan of their food.

## Getting Started

This application was created using the Expo XDE. The easiest way to get started would be to follow the installation steps below and then use the 'Open Project' option from XDE. From there, you can open the project in an iOS Simulator or send it to your device.

### Prerequisites

Note: While React Native supports developing cross-platform applications, for this project I am solely targeting iOS to streamline my workflow and quicken the development process.

- [Expo XDE](https://github.com/expo/xde/releases)
- [Expo iOS Client](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)

### Installing

Prior to opening the project in the Expo XDE, you will need to install the project's dependencies.

Navigate a terminal to the project's directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Once the node_modules directory is populated, the project should properly open and run via Expo XDE.

## Running the tests

Coming soon.

## Coding Style and Linting

Coding style consistency is important to me. This project was styled based on input from the Prettier plug-in for VSCode as well as an ESLint configuration that I've grown fond of which can be found in the devDependencies of package.json.

## Development

- master: Should be stable and ready to demo at any time.
- development: Active development directly on this branch as well as merged in from feature branches.

## Deployment

It's likely that I will publish this project to my personal [Expo Projects listing](https://expo.io/@maxmagee), but due to [recent restrictions by Apple](https://blog.expo.io/upcoming-limitations-to-ios-expo-client-8076d01aee1a), it's no longer possible to run Expo projects from other users in the iOS Client. Consequently, publishing there is simply to aide in my personal demos. I will not be publishing this to the App Store for obvious copyright reasons.

## Designs

Even though I have the existing production application available to base my work off of, I intend to pretend that I don't and will be building out the screens in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com).

Doing this will serve multiple purposes:

- Reinforces my understanding of the application design.
- Gain familiarity with a popular design program.

The Sketch files are available in the 'designs' directory.
